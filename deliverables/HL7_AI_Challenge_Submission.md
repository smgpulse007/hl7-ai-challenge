## Value Proposition

**Transform healthcare quality management from reactive "chase-and-close" to proactive "predict-and-prevent" care delivery through AI-powered HEDIS automation built on HL7 standards.**

---

## Innovation & Impact

### The Problem: Chase-and-Close Healthcare

Meet Sarah. Her **Colorectal Cancer Screening (COL)** was due on **November 17**. In the current 'chase-and-close' flow, a care coordinator gets a task, manually reviews charts, and chases calls between member, PCP, and specialist. The cycle averages **~45 days**. Sarah completed the screening—but **after** the due date, so she's non-compliant for COL. Our platform shifts to **predict-and-prevent**, so members like Sarah get timely nudges and fewer end-of-quarter scrambles.

### Our Innovation: Predict-and-Prevent Platform

- **GenAI Extraction Layer:** Converts unstructured clinical evidence (PDFs, notes) into structured proof of compliance
- **Predictive Analytics Layer:** XGBoost models predict non-compliance risk with 85%+ accuracy  
- **Standards Integration:** Seamless HL7 v2.x → FHIR R4 transformation with SMART on FHIR workflow integration
- **Real-time Clinical Decision Support:** Point-of-care alerts through CDS Hooks

### Current Deployments & Scale
