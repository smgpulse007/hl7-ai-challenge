# HEDIS AI Platform - VP Demo Script
## 10-Minute Executive Presentation

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
**"Every EMR can show you care gaps. What they CAN'T do is predict who won't close them, combine data from multiple sources beyond the EMR, or serve both payers and providers with the same intelligence. We're the only platform that does all three."**

   - Show risk factors: Transportation barriers, insurance issues, multiple no-shows
   - "High risk with 85% non-compliance probability"

4. **Value Statement**
   - "EMR-only systems would show 5 of these 8 members as non-compliant"
   - "We eliminate unnecessary outreach to 3 members who are already compliant"
   - "That's a 38% reduction in wasted outreach costs"

## Demo Checklist

### Pre-Demo Setup
- [ ] Verify all Docker services running: `docker-compose-v1 ps`
- [ ] Test Care Management Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Test Quality & Actuarial tab navigation
- [ ] Verify member modal functionality (click Maria Rodriguez)
- [ ] Check evidence extraction display
- [ ] Confirm financial metrics loading

### Key Metrics to Highlight
- **$1,715,250** Net ROI
- **69%** Cost reduction
- **3.2x** Efficiency improvement
- **65%** AI success rate vs. 20% traditional
- **38%** Reduction in unnecessary outreach
- **$1,872,000** Additional quality bonus revenue

### Backup Talking Points
- Market positioning: "Top 10% compliance vs. 68% market average"
- Competitive moat: "Only 5% market penetration for input-agnostic processing"
- Implementation timeline: "3-month pilot, 6-month full deployment"
- Success guarantee: "100% demonstrated pipeline success rate"

### Technical Fallbacks
- If dashboard doesn't load: Show static demo.html
- If APIs fail: Use browser developer tools to show network requests
- If modal doesn't open: Navigate directly to member details
- If data doesn't display: Refresh page and show loading states
