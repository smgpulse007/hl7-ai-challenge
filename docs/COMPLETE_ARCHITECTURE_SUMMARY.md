## üìä **Care Orchestration Service - Deep Dive**

### **üè• What It Actually Creates:**

The Care Orchestration Service is the **FHIR compliance engine** that transforms AI risk predictions into healthcare-standard resources:

#### **1. Patient Resource (FHIR R4)**
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "id": "patient-19961000155000",
  "identifier": [{"value": "19961000155000"}],
  "name": [{"given": ["Anonymous"], "family": "Member5000"}],
  "gender": "female",
  "birthDate": "1990-01-01"
}
```

#### **2. RiskAssessment Resource (FHIR R4)**
```json
{
  "resourceType": "RiskAssessment",
  "status": "final",
  "subject": {"reference": "Patient/patient-19961000155000"},
  "performer": {"display": "HEDIS AI Platform"},
  "prediction": [{
    "outcome": {"text": "Non-compliance risk for CCS"},
    "probabilityDecimal": 0.85,
    "qualitativeRisk": {"coding": [{"code": "high"}]}
  }],
  "note": [{"text": "AI-generated using XGBoost model. Risk: 85.0%"}]
}
```

#### **3. CarePlan Resource (FHIR R4)**
```json
{
  "resourceType": "CarePlan",
  "status": "active",
  "intent": "plan",
  "title": "CCS Care Gap Closure Plan",
  "subject": {"reference": "Patient/patient-19961000155000"},
  "activity": [
    {
      "detail": {
        "description": "Schedule cervical cancer screening (Pap smear)",
        "code": {"coding": [{"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "439958008"}]},
        "scheduledTiming": {"repeat": {"boundsPeriod": {"end": "2025-11-11"}}}
      }
    },
    {
      "detail": {
        "description": "Immediate care manager outreach for high-risk member",
        "scheduledTiming": {"repeat": {"boundsPeriod": {"end": "2025-08-20"}}}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **üéØ Business Logic Applied:**
- **HIGH Risk** ‚Üí 7-day intervention window
- **MEDIUM Risk** ‚Üí 45-day intervention window  
- **LOW Risk** ‚Üí 90-day intervention window
- **Care Plans** include specific SNOMED codes for EHR integration
- **Activities** have scheduled timing for provider workflow

## üöÄ **SMART on FHIR + CDS Hooks Integration**

### **‚úÖ What We Built:**

#### **1. SMART on FHIR App (Port 3002)**
- **EHR-integrated application** using SMART on FHIR standards
- **OAuth2 authentication** flow for EHR integration
- **Patient context** automatically loaded from EHR
- **FHIR resource visualization** within provider workflow

#### **2. CDS Hooks Server (Port 3001)**
- **Real-time clinical decision support** during provider workflow
- **Three hook types implemented:**
  - `patient-view` - Care gap alerts when viewing patient
  - `order-select` - Screening suggestions when ordering
  - `appointment-book` - Priority appointment recommendations

### **üéØ CDS Hooks in Action:**

#### **Patient-View Hook Response:**
```json
{
  "cards": [{
    "summary": "Cervical Cancer Screening Care Gap - HIGH Risk",
    "detail": "AI risk assessment indicates 85% probability of non-compliance. Intervention recommended by 2025-08-20.",
    "indicator": "critical",
    "suggestions": [{
      "label": "Order Cervical Cancer Screening",
      "actions": [{
        "type": "create",
        "resource": {
          "resourceType": "ServiceRequest",
          "code": {"coding": [{"system": "http://snomed.info/sct", "code": "439958008"}]}
        }
      }]
    }]
  }]
}
```

### **üè• EHR Integration Ready:**
- **Epic MyChart** - SMART on FHIR compliant
- **Cerner PowerChart** - FHIR R4 compatible
- **Allscripts** - CDS Hooks ready
- **Any FHIR R4 EHR** - Standards compliant

## üîÑ **Complete Data Flow Analysis**

### **üî¨ PDF Processing Reality:**
```
‚ùå What DIDN'T Work:
- PDF extraction failed due to base64 encoding format mismatch
- Ollama/Llama3 never called because no PDFs extracted
- All evidence_found = False

‚úÖ What DID Work:
- Ollama + Llama3 successfully loaded in Docker (CPU compatible)
- spaCy NLP models loaded and ready
- Service architecture and error handling working
- Your Layer 1 code integrated and ready
```

### **üéØ Risk Prediction Reality:**
```
‚úÖ What WORKED:
- Your actual XGBoost models loaded (CCS: AUC 0.7706, WCV: AUC 0.7399)
- Models making real predictions with synthetic features
- MLflow connected to IEHP server
- Risk stratification working (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

üîß What's SYNTHETIC:
- Member features generated from member_id hash (consistent but fake)
- In production: Would query PostgreSQL for real member data
```

### **üè• Care Orchestration Reality:**
```
‚úÖ What's REAL:
- Valid FHIR R4 resources created
- Business logic applied correctly
- Care gaps with intervention timing
- API endpoints working

üìä What's Generated:
- 1 Patient + 2 RiskAssessments + 2 CarePlans per member
- Care gaps with priority assignment
- SNOMED codes for EHR integration
```

### **üìä Dashboard Reality:**
```
‚úÖ What's LIVE:
- React dashboard running at http://localhost:3000
- Real-time data from Care Orchestration Service
- Provider-ready interface

üé≠ What's MOCK:
- Care gaps data is simulated but based on real member IDs
- Statistics calculated from mock data
- Real-time updates simulated
```

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Usage Analysis**

### **PostgreSQL (Port 5432) - READY BUT UNUSED**
```sql
-- What it WOULD store in production:
CREATE TABLE member_features (
    member_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    current_age INTEGER,
    pcp_visits_2023 INTEGER,
    avg_monthly_pcp_visits DECIMAL,
    chronic_condition_count INTEGER,
    utilization_score DECIMAL,
    sdoh_risk_score DECIMAL
);
```

### **Redis (Port 6379) - READY BUT UNUSED**
```
-- What it WOULD cache in production:
- Frequently accessed member features
- Model predictions (TTL: 24 hours)
- Session data for dashboard
- Real-time care gap updates
```
